I am sure that most of you will be celebrating Christmas at home in the company of your families and friends, but I know that some of you will not be so lucky.This year I am speaking to you from the Household Cavalry Barracks in Windsor because I want to draw attention to the many Servicemen and women who are stationed far from home this Christmas.I am thinking about their wives and children, and about their parents and friends. Separation at this time is especially hard to bear.It is not just a matter of separation. The men and women of the Services continue to face serious risks and dangers as they carry out their duties. They have done this brilliantly.I think we all have very good reasons for feeling proud of their achievements - both in war, and as they help to build a lasting peace in troublespots across the globe.None of this can be achieved without paying a price. I know that all our thoughts at this time are with the families who are suffering the pain of bereavement. All those who have recently lost a close relative or friend will know how difficult Christmas can be.These individual Servicemen and women are our neighbours and come from our own towns and villages; from every part of the country and from every background.The process of training within the Navy, the Army and the Air Force has moulded them together into disciplined teams.They have learnt to take responsibility and to exercise judgement and restraint in situations of acute stress and danger. They have brought great credit to themselves and to our country as a whole.I had an opportunity recently at the Barracks to meet some of those who played their part with such distinction in the Iraq operations. I was left with a deep sense of respect and admiration for their steadfast loyalty to each other and to our nation.I believe there is a lesson for us all here. It is that each of us can achieve much more if we work together as members of a team. The Founder of the Christian Faith himself chose twelve disciples to help him in his ministry.I was reminded of the importance of teamwork as I presented, for the first time last summer, The Queen's Awards for Voluntary Service by groups within the community.I have been struck by how often people say to me that they are receiving their award on behalf of a team and that they do not deserve to be singled out. This annual award recognises the team rather than the individual.In this country and throughout the Commonwealth there are groups of people who are giving their time generously to make a difference to the lives of others.As we think of them, and of our Servicemen and women far from home at this Christmas time, I hope we all, whatever our faith, can draw inspiration from the words of the familiar prayer:"Teach us good Lord To serve thee as thou deservest; To give, and not to count the cost; To fight, and not to heed the wounds; To toil, and not to seek for rest; To labour, and not to ask for any reward; Save that of knowing that we do thy will."It is this knowledge which will help us all to enjoy the Festival of Christmas.A happy Christmas to you all.Stirring examples of courage, commitment and selfless dedication to duty have been demonstrated in every Commonwealth nation and territory.Such a blend of traditions serves to make us stronger, individually and collectively, by providing the ingredients needed for social, political and economic resilienceOn behalf of the people The Trust has helped thank you to each and every one of you for all your incredible support, and to Your Majesty thank you for choosing to give the...It gives me great pleasure to welcome you all to the Commonwealth Science Conference in Singapore following the success of the Bangalore Conference in 2014. I am very grateful...Since you became an independent country in 1966, you have continued to flourish and grow into a strong and confident nation.On behalf of my grandmother, The Queen, I am grateful to the Government and the people of St. Lucia for this most generous contribution.Being inclusive and accepting diversity goes far deeper than accepting differences at face value and being tolerant.The baton relay represents a calling together of people from every part of the Commonwealth.In the Commonwealth, governments, businesses, communities and individuals should each strive to match words and good intentions with deeds. Every contribution has its part to...I have been warned I may have Happy Birthday sung to me more than once or twice.Despite its size and scale, the Commonwealth to me is still at heart a collection of villages.The Commonwealth is one of the great partnerships of the world where rich and poor, large and small, work together for the common good.Thank you, Mr Prime Minister of Canada, for making me feel so old!Ladies and gentlemen, I feel enormously proud of what the Commonwealth has achieved, and all of it within my lifetimeSt. Paul reminds us that all Christians, as ambassadors for Christ, are entrusted with the ministry of reconciliation.It is through this lens of history that we should view the conflicts of today, and so give us hope for tomorrow.At Christmas I am always struck by how the spirit of togetherness lies also at the heart of the Christmas story.Being united - that is, feeling a unity of purpose - is the glue that bonds together the members of a family, a country, a Commonwealth.All great religions have such times of renewal, moments to take stock before moving on to face the challenges which lie ahead.My hope this Christmas is that the Christian spirit of reconciliation may burn as strongly in our hearts during the coming year.In the United Kingdom we have our own particular sorrows in Northern Ireland and I want to send a special message of sympathy to all those men, women and children who have...My message today is one of encouragement and hope.Then Christmas comes, and once again we are reminded that people matter, and it is our relationship with one another that is most important.The Royal Household Â© Crown Copyright
