The day after my last Christmas message was broadcast, the world experienced one of the worst natural disasters ever recorded.The devastating tsunami struck countries around the Indian Ocean causing death and destruction on an unprecedented scale. This was followed by a number of vicious hurricanes across the Caribbean and the inundation of the city of New Orleans. Then in the autumn came the massive earthquake in Pakistan and India.This series of dreadful events has brought loss and suffering to so many people - and their families and friends - not only in the countries directly affected, but here in Britain and throughout the Commonwealth.As if these disasters were not bad enough, I have sometimes thought that humanity seemed to have turned on itself - with wars, civil disturbances and acts of brutal terrorism. In this country many people's lives were totally changed by the London bombings in July.This Christmas my thoughts are especially with those everywhere who are grieving the loss of loved ones during what for so many has been such a terrible year.These natural and human tragedies provided the headline news; they also provoked a quite remarkable humanitarian response. People of compassion all over the world responded with immediate practical and financial help.There may be an instinct in all of us to help those in distress, but in many cases I believe this has been inspired by religious faith. Christianity is not the only religion to teach its followers to help others and to treat your neighbour as you would want to be treated yourself.It has been clear that in the course of this year relief workers and financial support have come from members of every faith and from every corner of the world.There is no doubt that the process of rebuilding these communities is far from over and there will be fresh calls on our commitment to help in the future.Certainly the need for selflessness and generosity in the face of hardship is nothing new. The veterans of the Second World War whom we honoured last summer can tell us how so often, in moments of greatest trial, those around them seemed able to draw on some inner strength to find courage and compassion. We see this today in the way that young men and women are calmly serving our country around the world often in great danger.This last year has reminded us that this world is not always an easy or a safe place to live in, but it is the only place we have. I believe also that it has shown us all how our faith - whatever our religion - can inspire us to work together in friendship and peace for the sake of our own and future generations.For Christians this festival of Christmas is the time to remember the birth of the one we call "the Prince of Peace" and our source of "light and life" in both good times and bad. It is not always easy to accept his teaching, but I have no doubt that the New Year will be all the better if we do but try.I hope you will all have a very happy Christmas this year and that you go into the New Year with renewed hope and confidence.New Zealand is working to improve and strengthen all the various relationships between Maori and the Crown.It is both a privilege and a pleasure to have served as Queen of New Zealand for these fifty years.The Commonwealth remains one of the strongest pillars for the building of world-wide peace, growth and development.For Christmas marks a moment to pause, to reflect and believe in the possibilities of rebirth and renewal.By any measure this Millennium year has been an unforgettable one.This December we are looking back not just on one year, but on a hundred years and a thousand years.Though we each lead different lives, the experience of growing older, and the joys and emotions which it brings, are familiar to us all.He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years.May those who died rest in peace and may we, each and every one of us, thank God for someone who made many, many people happy.I remember my own childhood Christmases here, with my father and mother, and a great family gathering, and now I delight in seeing my children and grandchildren enjoying the...But I cannot think of any Christmas of my reign when the message of the angels has been more apt.So, our Commonwealth hearth becomes more precious than ever before by the contrast between its homely security and the storm which sometimes seems to be brewing outside, in...To see British and Russian veterans standing together, in memory of the sacrifices of their comrades-in-arms, was a moving experience.We have indeed become a global village.I first came here for Christmas as a grandchild.
