# Royal Christmas Speeches <br>

**1. About the folder**<br>
This folder contains materials of Group H’s group project for the subject Tools and Methods.

**2. Corpus**<br>
Our corpus includes the transcripts of Christmas speeches given by the British Queen Elizabeth II from 1952 to 2021 and her successor King Charles III in 2022 and 2023. The corpus consists of 72 speeches altogether.

**3. Target audience**<br>
The corpus is suitable for researchers who are interested in the Christmas messages given by the British royal family, especially in their analysis from a text-based perspective.

**4. Text selection criteria**<br>
We intended to gather the entirety of the Christmas speeches given by the late Queen Elizabeth II and her son’s, King Charles III’s, Christmas speeches that he has delivered up until now. We aimed to compare the current King’s speeches with those of the late Queen’s. The speeches comprise a homogeneous corpus.

**5. Dataset**<br>
We worked with the text files that resulted from the data collection and the cleaning processes of our Collecting Data project (cleaned_text_files folder).<br>
For more information on the data collection and cleaning processes, please see the [README.md](https://github.com/kin0330/Royal-Christmas-Speeches-Team-H/blob/main/Collecting%20Data/README.md) file of our Collecting Data project. 

**6. Research questions - Tools and Methods**<br>
1. Does the style of the Queen’s Christmas speeches evolve over time or does it stay the same? <br>
2. Are King Charles III's speeches stylistically similar or dissimilar to Queen Elizabeth's Christmas speeches? <br>
3. a) What are the most used words by the Queen in 1952, 1953 and by the King in 2022, 2023? (a comparison of the Queen’s and the King’s first two speeches) <br>
b) What are the most used words by the Queen in 2020, 2021 and by the King in 2022, 2023? (a comparison of the last two speeches of the Queen and the first two speeches of the King, from the perspective of continuity)

**7. Stylometric analysis - Tools and Methods**<br>
In order to answer our research questions for Tools and Methods, we carried out a stylometric analysis and utilized the Stylo package of R.<br>
We used Cluster Analysis and Craig's Zeta score and visualized the results in the form of dendrograms and graphs.<br>

**8. Research output**<br>
To publish our findings, we created the following website: https://royal-christmas-messages.my.canva.site/
