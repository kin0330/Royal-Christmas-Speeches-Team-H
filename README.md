# Linguistic style analysis of Queen Elizabeth II's Christmas speeches
## Description
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive linguistic analysis of Queen Elizabeth II's Christmas speeches. By analyzing a dataset consisting of 72 speeches delivered by Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles III, this project seeks to explore linguistic patterns, content, and changes in her speech style over the years.
## Dataset description
The dataset used for this analysis consists of 70 Christmas speeches from Queen Elizabeth II and 2 speeches from King Charles III. The dataset includes transcripts of these speeches, compiled from official sources and archives.
## Active Learning Exercise?
Option 1: Check for similarity between Elizabeth and Charles’ styles with author attribution

Option 2: Make a speech anonymous and attribute it to Elizabeth or Charles

Option 3: Craig’s Zeta with Elizabeth and her father’s speeches or Elizabeth and Charles’ speeches.
## Methodology and Tools
### Data Collection
The dataset was compiled by leveraging web scraping techniques using Python from the official Royal Family website, specifically https://www.royal.uk/. This process ensured the gathering of comprehensive and accurate transcripts or recordings of Queen Elizabeth II's Christmas speeches.

### Text Analysis
The analysis employed a two-fold approach:
#### Distant Reading
Using the Stylo package, a distant reading technique, to analyze linguistic patterns, including vocabulary usage, stylistic elements, and broader linguistic features from the corpus of speeches.
#### Close Reading
Using contextual analysis methods to research specific sections or themes within individual speeches.

### Visualization
The dataset was visualized through various graph and website representations.
