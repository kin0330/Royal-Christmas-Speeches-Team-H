## Methodology and Tools
### Data Collection
The dataset was compiled by leveraging web scraping techniques using Python from the official Royal Family website, specifically https://www.royal.uk/. This process ensured the gathering of comprehensive and accurate transcripts or recordings of Queen Elizabeth II's Christmas speeches.

### Text Analysis
The analysis employed a two-fold approach:
#### Distant Reading
Using the Stylo package, a distant reading technique, to analyze linguistic patterns, including vocabulary usage, stylistic elements, and broader linguistic features from the corpus of speeches.
#### Close Reading
Using contextual analysis methods to research specific sections or themes within individual speeches.

### Visualization
The dataset was visualized through various graph and website representations.
